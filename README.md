# Data-Analysis-and-Decision-Science

## Description

This course provides a mathematically rigorous and broad foundation for key concepts in probability and statistics, as well as the application of probability and statistics to the mathematical modeling of non-deterministic systems. The main motivation of the course is to show how these concepts are fundamental to a variety of current data analysis techniques, and to demonstrate applications of these techniques in situations relevant to all engineering majors.
